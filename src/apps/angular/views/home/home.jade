        p.restrict-width For the past 12 months, I've been working as the lead and sole developer, designer and UX/UI on a large scale web app built with AngularJS 1.4 and powered by a REST API.
        p.restrict-width I was hired as the company was just starting out and no work had been done on the web app. I opted for using a stack of AngularJS, Jade, Sass & Grunt as these fit the requirements the best.
        p.restrict-width Here I will walk through the build and thought process as well as the numerous challenges and struggles that went into building this.
